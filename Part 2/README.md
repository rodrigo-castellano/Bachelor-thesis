# Bachelor-thesis
In this project cosmic rays from a detector Cherenkov are analyzed by supervised learning algorithms.

Features

     •X position in the hexagonal grid
     •Y position in the hexagonal grid
     •Number of event
     •Intensity of the pixel in (X,Y)

Labels: 

    0 --> gamma  
    
    1 --> electron
    
    2 --> proton 
    
    3 --> nitrogen  
    
    4 --> iron 
    
    5 --> silicum
    
    6 --> helium
     
Algotirthms that are used: Neural network and convolutional neural network
