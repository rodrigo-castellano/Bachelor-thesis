# Bachelor-thesis
In this project cosmic rays from a detector Cherenkov are analyzed by supervised learning algorithms.

Features
    1. NALLParticlesTotal : Total number of particles generated by the event in the ground level.
    2. MUTotal : Total number of muons.
    3. ELTotal : Total number of electromagnetic particles.
    4. Zenith : Zenith angle of the particle [degrees].
    5. Energy : Particle energy [GeV].

Labels: photon, proton, helium, nitrogen, iron. The smallest number is assigned to photon (A=0) and the highest number to the heaviest particle, this is, iron (B=4).
     0 -->  photon  
     1 --> proton
     2 --> helium 
     3 --> nitrogen  
     4 --> iron 
     
Algotirthms that are used: KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic regression, Neural network.
