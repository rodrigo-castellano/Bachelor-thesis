# Bachelor-thesis
In this project for the thesis of the bachelor in physics there are two parts. 

For the first part supervised learning algorithms are applied to a dataset extracted from a detector of cosmic radiation. The algorithms are KNN, SVM, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, logistic regression and a neural network. 

For the second part cosmic rays are analyzed with a cherenkov detector. For this purpose, CNN are studied and applied.
