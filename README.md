# Bachelor-thesis
This is a project for the bachelor thesis consisting of two parts:

For the first part supervised learning algorithms are applied to a dataset extracted from the CORSIKA simulator (Pierre Auger Observatory). The goal is to identify the particles that produce cosmic rays. The algorithms are KNN, SVM, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, logistic regression and a neural network. 

For the second part, cosmic rays are analyzed again for several particles. The simulated data comes from the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), due to the Cherenkov effect. For this purpose, convolutional neural networks are studied and applied.
